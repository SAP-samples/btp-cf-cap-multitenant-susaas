# Develop a multitenant Software as a Service application in SAP BTP using CAP (Cloud Foundry)

## Important

Hi follow developers, 

We've got some news to share about our SAP-samples repositories, where we show you how to create those cool **multitenant SaaS apps** using the **Cloud Application Programming Model** (CAP) based on the **SAP BTP, Cloud Foundry** and **Kyma Runtime**. We've brought together these repositories into a **single home**, and you can check it out right here - **https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-cap-multitenant-saas**. We made this change to ensure things stay organized and streamlined in the future. Keeping separate code lines and documentation requires a lot of effort, and we'd rather spend our time enhancing our sample scenario and making things more efficient!

Long story short - originally, we had **two stories** – one for the SAP BTP, Kyma and one for the Cloud Foundry Environment, but both about building those nifty SaaS apps on SAP BTP. Over the last months, it turned out, they were kind of like cousins, with just a few differences like how they do things (like using API Rules in Kyma or setting up Routes in Cloud Foundry). So, we decided to combine their stories into **one central place**. This is like having a cool book that has both of their adventures!

What does this mean for **you**? Well, now you have a single, **easy-to-go-to place** for learning about developing and deploying our beloved multitenant **Sustainable SaaS** sample application to both the SAP BTP, Kyma and Cloud Foundry Runtime. This will be where we update stuff from now on. If you **need help** or want to talk about anything, we've set up a new spot for that too. Just use the **GitHub Issues** feature of our new repository to get in touch, and remember not to chat about it in the old repositories – we won't be checking there anymore.

While we're moving things around, in this **Cloud Foundry**-based **legacy book**, the original parts (branches) of the story called **main**, **basic** and **advanced** will be moving to new branches called **archive/main**, **archive/basic** and **archive/advanced** for a while. So, if you want to remember how that story went, you can still visit it there.

Oh, and one more thing – the **documentation** is moving too. The latest version now lives in the new place with both stories. Once again, the **new repository** - **https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-cap-multitenant-saas.** 

Thanks for being awesome and joining us on this journey!
