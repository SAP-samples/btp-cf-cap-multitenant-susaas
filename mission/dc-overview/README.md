## Tile Description

Develop a multitenant Software as a Service application in SAP BTP using CAP

## Description

In this mission you will learn how to set up a multitenant Software as a Service (SaaS) application in the SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) using CAP. 

The sample application has a focus on the topic of sustainability and shows how to use a SaaS approach to share costly resources like SAP HANA Cloud among several tenants (multitenant).  

It allows consumers of your SaaS application to extend their SAP solutions like SAP S/4HANA with additional features provided by you as a SaaS provider. 

## Pain Points

Customers and partners in the SAP ecosphere have developed various SAP based solutions and extensions in the last decades. With increased adoption of SAP BTP, the question arises how these stakeholders can develop and sell their own solutions using the platform capabilities.  

## Benefits

Following a multitenant Software as a Service approach as covered by this mission, customers and partners can develop and monetize their own software solutions integrating with SAP solutions (like SAP S/4HANA) or SAP BTP service offerings. 

Compared to traditional deployments to a customer's on-premise infrastructure this approach is much faster, simpler and leads to minimal marginal costs the more customers are onboarded.  

## Journey

The mission will take you from a Basic Scope containing the most important foundations of a basic SaaS application to an Advanced and Expert Scope for those stakeholders out there willing to take the opportunity of building their own SaaS product on SAP BTP.
