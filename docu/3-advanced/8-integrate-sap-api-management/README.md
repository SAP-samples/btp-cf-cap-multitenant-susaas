# Integrate SAP API Management

As your SaaS application contains an API that allows the SaaS consumers to interact programmatically with their tenant database containers, you need to ensure that your API endpoints are properly managed and monitored. For this purpose, you should implement features like rate limiting to prevent e.g., DoS attacks. Furthermore, you can ensure fair usage of the resources among your consumers by e.g., setting up a quota depending on the chosen plan. A premium consumer might be eligible to send more requests per second than a standard consumer. Proper monitoring of your API will help you to analyze performance issues and to identify problems of your consumers. 

In this part of the mission, you will learn how to ensure that each and every request to your SaaS API is first going through SAP API Management, which will be the dedicated standard solution provided by SAP for all API-related requirements.

## 1. Architecture

SAP API Management is a new component in the central part of the **Advanced Scope** architecture. While in the Basic Scope, the API calls were directly accessing the CAP-based API service, now all requests will be passing through this additional component, giving you great flexibility in how to handle your in and outbound API traffic. 

See the relevant part of the solution architecture below (click to enlarge):

![<img src="./images/API_Architecture.png" width="500" />](./images/API_Architecture.png?raw=true)


## 2. Prerequisites

For this setup, please make sure you have an SAP API Management instance up and running. As SAP API Management is a capability of **SAP Integration Suite**, please subscribe to SAP Integration Suite and activate the respective **API Management** feature. Check the following SAP Help documentation to find a detailed step-by-step guide ([click here](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_CLOUD_PLATFORM_API_MANAGEMENT/66d066d903c2473f81ec33acfe2ccdb4/f6eb4332cd5144ef91f4a84cc614ba1c.html?locale=en-US)). 

![<img src="./images/API_IntegrationSuite.png" width="500" />](./images/API_IntegrationSuite.png?raw=true)


## 3. APIM as route service

To connect your SaaS API with SAP API Management, you can use an SAP BTP service called "APIM-as-route-service", which is also explained in greater detail by the following blog posts [click here](https://blogs.sap.com/2020/10/10/sap-apim-route-service-plan-to-manage-cloud-foundry-apps/) and [here](https://blogs.sap.com/2020/08/10/part-3-service-plan-of-sap-api-management-in-cloud-foundry-environment/). Further information about route services can be found in the official Cloud Foundry documentation [click here](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/route-services.html).

Combining this service instance with your API route allows you to enforce API policies like Spike Arrest or Quotas no matter whether the accessing client is calling the API Proxy URL or the standard route of your API. So please set up an instance of the **apim-as-a-route-service** offering as you can see in the following screenshot. 

> **Hint** - If you cannot find the respective service plan, make sure you assigned it in your subaccount entitlements!

![<img src="./images/API_ServiceInstance.png" width="500" />](./images/API_ServiceInstance.png?raw=true)

As SAP Integration Suite is one of the most powerful but also quite expensive SaaS products, you might consider the usage for your productive SaaS environment only.


## 4. Bind the route service

Now you need to bind the route service to your standard SaaS API route. This can be done using the cf CLI command bind-route-service (or brs). 

**Windows (Command Line)**
cf brs `<API service domain>` `<route service>` --hostname `<API service hostname>` -c '{\"api_name\":\"`<API-Proxy name>`\"}'

**Windows (Power Shell)**
cf brs `<API service domain>` `<route service>` --hostname `<API service hostname>` -c "{\"api_name\":\"`<API-Proxy name>`\"}"

* **route service** - The name of your route-service instance created in the [last step](./README.md#3-apim-as-route-service).
* **API-Proxy name** - You're free to choose the name of your API-Proxy in API Management.
* **API service domain** - The domain of your API service like *cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com*.
* **API service hostname** - The hostname of your API service returned by the *cf apps* CLI command. <br>
![<img src="./images/API_Hostname.png" width="500" />](./images/API_Hostname.png?raw=true)


>**Sample**<br>
>cf brs cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com susaas-apim-route-service --hostname dev-susaas-api-srv -c '{\"api_name\":\"SusaaS-API-Proxy\"}'

> **Important** - The command might differ depending on your cf CLI version. You can use *cf brs --help* to find the correct command related to your cf CLI version. Also make sure to change the change the API service domain in case of Custom Domain usage.

After successfully running this command in your cf CLI, you will see a new API Proxy called **SusaaS-API-Proxy** in your SAP API Management **Develop** menu. 

![<img src="./images/API_Proxy.png" width="500" />](./images/API_Proxy.png?raw=true)

Checking the API Proxy details you will see in the description that this API Proxy is bound to a Cloud Foundry application which is your SaaS API. From now on, all requests reaching your SaaS API route will be running through SAP API Management, and respective API policies are applied.

![<img src="./images/API_ProxyDetails.png" width="500" />](./images/API_ProxyDetails.png?raw=true)


## 5. API Policies 

You can now apply relevant API Policies to your API Proxy using preconfigured templates and features. In this sample, you will learn how to set up a Spike Arrest component for rate limiting and different quotas based on the plan (standard/premium) subscribed by the consumer. 

5.1. To set up the respective policies, click on **Policies** in the top right of your API Proxy. 

![<img src="./images/API_Policies.png" width="300" />](./images/API_Policies.png?raw=true)

5.2. Switch to edit mode by clicking on **Edit** in the Policy Editor. 

![<img src="./images/API_EditMode.png" width="300" />](./images/API_EditMode.png?raw=true)


## 6. Decode the JWT token

6.1. Open the PreFlow of your API Proxy, where you will place the rate limiter of your API. You will see that the flow already contains some elements which were created when setting up the service-route instance. Please leave them as is. Check the following [SAP Help documentation](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_CLOUD_PLATFORM_API_MANAGEMENT/66d066d903c2473f81ec33acfe2ccdb4/08b40d9e47a0470a8b14cc47abab89ec.html?locale=en-US) to learn more about **Flows** in SAP API Management.

6.2. In this use-case, we will distinguish our SaaS API clients by their unique Client ID, which can be found in the JWT token of each request. Therefore, please first add a feature called **DecodeJWT** which will allow you to make use of the JWT token content in subsequent steps. 

![<img src="./images/API_DecodeJWT01.png" width="500" />](./images/API_DecodeJWT01.png?raw=true)

6.3. You can name the flow element **decodeJwt**. If you choose a different name, please note it down as you will need it in one of the next steps. 

![<img src="./images/API_DecodeJWT02.png" width="300" />](./images/API_DecodeJWT02.png?raw=true)

6.4. Please remove the **`<Source>var.jwt</Source>`** line from the configuration. 

![<img src="./images/API_DecodeJWT03.png" width="500" />](./images/API_DecodeJWT03.png?raw=true)


## 7. Spike Arrest feature

7.1. After decoding the JWT token, please add the **Spike Arrest** feature from your policies toolbox. You can name the flow element **spikeArrest**. 

![<img src="./images/API_SpikeArrest01.png" width="500" />](./images/API_SpikeArrest01.png?raw=true)

7.2. Configure your Spike Arrest instance by providing the identifier which is the Client-ID in our case (see below). The required information is coming from the previous flow element used to decode the JWT token. You might need to change the **decodeJwt** value in case you named your flow element differently. 

```xml
<Identifier ref="jwt.decodeJwt.claim.client_id"/>
```

7.3. Furthermore, feel free to update the number of requests which you want to allow per minute (pm) or second (ps). Check the documentation [click here](https://docs.apigee.com/api-platform/reference/policies/spike-arrest-policy) of Spike Arrest as the configuration options are very comprehensive. 

```xml
<Rate>1ps</Rate> instead of <Rate>30pm</Rate>
```

![<img src="./images/API_SpikeArrest02.png" width="600" />](./images/API_SpikeArrest02.png?raw=true)


## 8. API quotas

Besides an API rate limiter feature preventing you from e.g. DoS attacks, you can also enhance your SaaS API by introducing a **plan**-based quota for your consumers. This allows you to differentiate premium from standard consumers and enables interested consumers an increased usage of your API. 

8.1. Let's start by introducing different subflows for your different API plans. To create a new subflow for the API Proxy PreFlow just click on the respective **+** icon.

![<img src="./images/API_Quota01.png" width="600" />](./images/API_Quota01.png?raw=true)

8.2. Create two new subflows called **standardPlanFlow** and **premiumPlanFlow**. These flows will be executed after the generic PreFlow depending on conditions you define. 

![<img src="./images/API_Quota02.png" width="200" />](./images/API_Quota02.png?raw=true)

8.3. We will differentiate the incoming requests by using the decoded JWT token again. Based on the configuration of the SaaS API, we decided to inject the selected service plan into the token issued by XSUAA. This allows you to read the consumer tenant's plan from the JWT token and include it into the **Flow Condition** like the following. 

> **Hint** - Please make sure to select the **standardPlanFlow** before adding the condition. 

```jwt.decodeJwt.claim.scope ~ "*plan_standard"```

![<img src="./images/API_Quota03.png" width="600" />](./images/API_Quota03.png?raw=true)

8.4. For the premiumPlanFlow the condition will look as follows. Please add it accordingly. 

```jwt.decodeJwt.claim.scope ~ "*plan_premium*"```

> **Hint** - The service plan identification using the JWT scope claim might be improved by a better approach in the future.

8.5. Now we can send requests through different flows depending on the consumer tenant's plan, we will now add different quota allowances based on the plans. To add a quota limit to your API, add the **Quota** feature from your policies toolbox. Name your flow element **quotaStandard** in the standard flow and **quotaPremium** in the premium flow. 

![<img src="./images/API_Quota04.png" width="600" />](./images/API_Quota04.png?raw=true)

8.6. For this very simple sample application you can configure your quota the following. This configuration will allow your consumers 1200 requests to your API per (1) day. The very comprehensive configuration options of the **Quota** feature can be found in the respective documentation [click here](https://docs.apigee.com/api-platform/reference/policies/quota-policy). Please ensure, the quota configuration also contains the Client ID as an identifier. 

> For the **premium plan**, you can e.g., double the allowed number of requests per day to 2400 or use another configuration of your choice.  

```xml
<Quota async="false" continueOnError="false" enabled="true" type="calendar" xmlns="http://www.sap.com/apimgmt">
 	<Identifier ref="jwt.decodeJwt.claim.client_id"/>
 	<Allow count="1200"/>
 	<Interval>1</Interval>
	<Distributed>true</Distributed>
 	<StartTime>2015-2-11 12:00:00</StartTime>
	<Synchronous>true</Synchronous>
 	<TimeUnit>day</TimeUnit>
</Quota>
```

![<img src="./images/API_Quota05.png" width="600" />](./images/API_Quota05.png?raw=true)


## 9. Update policies and deploy 

9.1. After setting up the sample policies, please click on **Update** in the upper right of your Policies editor. 

![<img src="./images/API_Deploy01.png" width="300" />](./images/API_Deploy01.png?raw=true)

9.2. Save your API Proxy changes by clicking on **Save**. 

![<img src="./images/API_Deploy02.png" width="200" />](./images/API_Deploy02.png?raw=true)

9.3. Make sure to **Deploy** the latest version of your API Proxy by selecting the respective option. 

![<img src="./images/API_Deploy03.png" width="300" />](./images/API_Deploy03.png?raw=true)


## 10. Test the setup

That's it, you've successfully integrated your SaaS API with SAP API Management and already configured some API Policies. To test the setup, feel free to create a new service key in a consumer subaccount (or use an existing one) and try calling your API endpoint e.g., using the sample HTTP files.

You will notice that calling the API more than once per second (e.g. using Postman or the HTTP files), will result in an error message sent by SAP API Management as the Spike Arrest policy will jump in. 


## 11. Deployment Descriptor

The API Management as route service (sap-apim-route-service) instance can also be defined in your mta.yaml deployment descriptor. Just add the following code snippet to your resources. Still, you will need to execute the **cf bind-route-service** command as described in this tutorial. 

```yaml
  # ----------------- API Route Service -------------------------------------------
  - name: susaas-api-route-service
  # -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    type: org.cloudfoundry.managed-service
    parameters:
      service: apimanagement-apiportal
      service-plan: apim-as-route-service
```
