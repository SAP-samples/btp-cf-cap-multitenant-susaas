# Unsubscribe from a Consumer Subaccount

If a consumer subaccount is subscribed to the multitenant Sustainable SaaS application and created a service instance for the related SaaS API, the subaccount should look like the below (click to enlarge).

The following steps show how to unsubscribe from the SaaS application and how to remove the API Broker instance from such a consumer subaccount. This is a prerequisite in case you want to deploy the **Advanced Scope** to the same landscape.

## 2. Check successful Unsubscription

Check if Sustainable SaaS API Broker is unregistered. The **Sustainable SaaS API Broker** is automatically unregistered when unsubscribing from the Sustainable SaaS app in a consumer subaccount. Consequently, the Sustainable SaaS API should not be visible in a consumer subaccount anymore, when a new service instance creation attempt is made from that subaccount. 

As you can see below, the **Sustainable SaaS API** is not visible anymore.

> **Hint** - If your broker is not unregistered automatically, you should unregister it with SAP BTP CLI using this [command](https://help.sap.com/docs/BTP/btp-cli/btp-unregister-services-broker.html). Make sure your service broker is unregistered because otherwise you can **not** delete the consumer subaccount.
